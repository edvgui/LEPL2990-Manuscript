\chapter{Measurements}

In this chapter, based on the results of the tests presented in the previous chapter, I will try to answer several questions:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item What is the influence of each storage driver on the performance, which one is the best for us?
  \item What is the influence of each container runtime on the performance, which one is the best for us?
  \item What is the influence of each container manager on the performance, which one is the best for us?
  \item What is the influence of each base image on the performance, which one is the best for us?
  \item Does the a rootless container have any performance drawback over a rootfull one?
\end{enumerate}

Based on that, I will try to compose the best solution that should be used in the case of INGInious.
