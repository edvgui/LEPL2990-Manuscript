\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

\paragraph{}A thesis is not a one-man job, this one has been made possible thanks to the intervention of many people.  My deepest thanks go to my promoter, Professor Ramin Sadre, who guided me along this long project, providing support and advices and taking all the time required to do so accordingly.  A special thanks goes also to Professor Etienne Riviere who showed great interest in my work, and provided valuable advices.

\paragraph{}Of course, this project would not even have seen a day if Professor Olivier Bonaventure did not talk me into it initially. It made me discover a new world, for this I am very grateful.  Thank you also to Anthony Gego for answering my numerous questions relating to INGInious, to Mathieu Jadin for helping me in my first steps with cgroupv2, to Guillaume Rosinosky for setting me up an access to one of UCL's nuc.  Outside UCL, other people helped me too: thank you to Corentin Badot-Bertrand for introducing me to Ansible, thank you to the \textit{Kata Containers} community and to the \textit{containers} organization for helping me with different issues.

\paragraph{}And finally, I would like to thank my family and friends for supporting me throughout this project, showing interest and offering support by all times.  This is especially addressed to Anne, Nicolas and Tom.
