I studied different containerization solutions available, in different configurations, with the goal of determining the most appropriate one for INGInious.  That solution would be the one that can provide the best responsiveness while meeting the safety requirement that the platform has.  Based on my obervations I then present what would be the ideal solution for INGInious, with its performance gain over the best currently available solution and its drawbacks.  Finally I address the performance cost of enforcing the isolation level, as some solutions offer, and the opportunities it brings to the platform.
